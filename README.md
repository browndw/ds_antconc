# ds_antconc

This repository contains a short R markdown script that is designed to format the token *.csv files created by DocuScope into text files that can processed by AntConc.

The respoitory also contains a *.yml file containing the hierarchy of DocuScope categories for the dictionary distributed on 1/20/2020. If you're using a different dictionary, you will need a different YAML file.

After you've run the script on your files, refer to [this documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T5yus4WjgxDOEhb81tk59GOEYCtDrO0ZanYFyLjrhTM/edit?usp=sharing) for configuring AntConc. Note the documentation requires a CMU login.
